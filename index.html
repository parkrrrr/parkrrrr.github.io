<h1>Ron Parker's github projects</h1>
<p>Welcome to my little corner of github. For now, this page doesn't contain anything notable, but 
I intend to use it as a jumping-off point for a number of useful things that I've made and made 
available for you to use.</p>
<p>Foremost among those is <a href="http://github.com/parkrrrr/bdio">BDIOHID</a>, 
which is a firmware package for certain Linux Single-Board Computers which leverages 
<a href="http://brltty.app/">brltty</a> to provide HID Braille access to legacy refreshable Braille display
devices.</p>
<p>Other things you might find lying around in my github repo:
<ul>
<li>Thermo, which is a set of programs designed to run on a Raspberry pi and control a kiln, as long as your kiln uses an 
Omega 77000-series setpoint controller with an RS-232 interface, which it probably doesn't. </li>
<li>HIDScout, which is an as-yet-unfinished attempt to write a report descriptor browser for HID devices for Windows. I got as 
far as extracting the data and printing it with a command-line utility, but haven't finished any of the GUI work. This project 
was originally conceived as a way to break the deadlock between having no HID Braille hardware with which to test new software, 
and no software with which to test new hardware. The project was soft-abandoned because I found something even better to break
that deadlock, but that story isn't mine to tell.</li>
</ul>
